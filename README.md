a pinball score recorder and visualizer because a spreadsheet would be too easy!

if you have a keyboard, arrows cycle through the list, the item selected effects the others keys; ENTER, DELETE and BACKSPACE

when 'table' is selected
  · ENTER, brings the prompt for adding a new table, if the table already exists it gets focused
  · DELETE, removes the tables and all the players data associated with

when 'score' is selected
  · ENTER, brings the prompt for adding a score, only numbers are accepted
  · BACKSPACE, deletes the last added data point
  · DELETE, removes all the points for the selected player

when 'player' is selected
  · ENTER, brings a prompt for adding a new player, if the player already exists it gets focused
  · DELETE, deletes the player and every score tied with it

buttons on the screen were meant to facilitate mobile usage, gotta test although... the "LOCK" button unlocks "X" (DELETE) and "REDO" (BACKSPACE) functionality
